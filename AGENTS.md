# AGENTS.md — KS

Original selling landing for Kristina Aquila's web design practice. Bilingual:
**English is the default and serves `/`**, Argentinian Spanish is at `/es/`, and
the retired `/en/` prefix redirects to the root. Read
[`README.md`](./README.md) first for the verified facts and the open items.

## Identity

The reference is a printed café menu card: white paper, black ink, hairline
rules, heavy tracked capitals. Everything below follows from that.

- **The palette is achromatic but for the wordmark's dot.** White ground,
  near-black ink, a short grey ramp — no accent colour on links, buttons or any
  other UI. Hierarchy is carried by weight, tracking, rules and scale, the way
  it is on paper. The single sanctioned exception (client decision,
  2026-08-19) is `--brand-gold` on the wordmark dot described below. A test
  walks every hex colour in the compiled stylesheet, allows exactly that one
  value, and fails any other whose RGB channels spread more than 12, so a stray
  blue cannot slip in.
- Type is two families, both already licensed in this repository: **Manrope**
  for the wordmark, headings, navigation and body; **Playfair Display** for the
  chapter numerals, the pull quotes and the italic line in the contact band —
  nowhere else. Do not add a third family.
- Headings are uppercase with open tracking (`0.06em`–`0.09em`), not tight
  display type.
- **A section is opened by its heading and nothing else.** The small-caps label
  over a rule and the lead paragraph beneath both restated the heading, so all
  three of them said one thing three times; the label and the lead are gone and
  the `.eyebrow` rule with them. Do not reintroduce either — if a section needs
  explaining, the heading is wrong. The one lead paragraph left on the site is
  on the 404 page, which has no hierarchy to explain itself with.
- **One call to action per screen.** "Start a project" belongs to the hero. The
  header's top-right button is Contact, and the services head carries no button
  at all; a test counts the hero's label and fails at two.
- The language switch is two small words separated by a slash, the current one
  underlined — printed, not app-like. Each is a 44px target and a plain link.
- **Portfolio screenshots are shown at their own 8:5 proportion**, never cropped
  and never stretched: a card that reframes the work is showing something the
  client never designed. The shot sets no height and no `object-fit`. When the
  slide is too short for the cards at that ratio, `.work-track` narrows them —
  the container is left alone so the heading keeps the section's left edge.
- The process numerals grow slightly on hover. Any motion added here stays at
  that scale: a transform on one element, killed by `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- The wordmark is **typography, not an image**: `ks·design` set in Manrope as
  tracked uppercase at the nav's type size, with a gold dot on the baseline
  between the two words — nearer the KS than the DESIGN in a 1:2 proportion
  (client decision, 2026-08-19; the dot replaced the hyphen of the earlier
  bold lowercase `ks-design`). The dot uses `--brand-gold`, the page's only
  chromatic token, and a test allows exactly that hex and no other colour.
  There is still no logo image, and the old gradient monogram is gone and
  should not come back. Running text and footer credits keep plain
  `ks-design`; the mark is a header-only device. The favicon carries the same
  treatment as a type-set `KS.` with dark-scheme inversion, plus a baked PNG
  because Safari ignores SVG favicons.
- The footer is **one horizontal row directly under the contact band**, and the
  pair is anchored to the bottom of the last slide: copyright hard left, a pin
  icon and the location centred on the page, social icons with no labels hard
  right (LinkedIn, Telegram, Instagram). Its outer grid columns are `1fr` so the
  middle one centres on the page rather than on the copyright. It carries no
  rule on top — the black band above it already divides the page, and the band
  must not be pushed away from it by a spacer row.
- Tone: calm, concrete, premium. No urgency timers, no invented counters, no
  exclamation marks.

## The deck

Each section is a `.slide`. Above `900px` wide **and** `660px` tall the page
becomes a deck: every slide is one viewport and the page snaps between them.
Below that it is an ordinary flowing document.

- Slides use `min-height: 100svh`, never a fixed `height` with
  `overflow: hidden`. A slide is exactly one screen whenever its content fits
  and grows instead of clipping when it does not — silently eating the last
  line of copy on a short laptop window is worse than a slide that scrolls.
- The work slide preserves each screenshot's 8:5 ratio by letting height follow
  width. In deck mode, `.work-track` therefore caps its width from the viewport
  height left after the header, container padding, heading and card meta:
  `(100svh - var(--header-h) - 25rem) × 1.6 × 2`, plus the card gap. Cap the
  track rather than `.work > .container`, so the cards narrow on short screens
  while the heading keeps the same left edge as every other slide. If those
  vertical allowances change, re-measure the `25rem` term rather than assume.
- Entrance reveals are claimed by the script (`html.reveal-on`), never written
  into the markup. A visitor without JavaScript, or with reduced motion, gets
  every slide fully visible.

## Content

- Source of truth is [`src/content.js`](./website/src/content.js). Every string
  on the page comes from there, in every language. A key that exists in one
  language must exist in all of them, and `languages` declares both the URL for
  each locale and the order the switch renders in.
- The years of experience are derived from `CAREER_START_YEAR`, never typed. A
  literal number passes today and lies next January.
- Do not invent facts, prices, testimonials, client names or dates. Kind Words
  is deliberately unfilled and must remain absent from published pages while
  its content is marked `todo`; see README.
- A translation the owner has not signed off on is not final copy either. List
  such a locale in `localesAwaitingReview` and the build names it on every run,
  the way it names placeholder sections. The owner approved the current `es`
  copy on 2026-08-17, so it is not on that list.
- The years of experience are **derived** from `CAREER_START_YEAR`, never typed.
  Copy uses the `%YEARS%` placeholder. A test fails if the literal is hardcoded.
- Approved external destinations are listed in `links`. A test rejects any other
  outbound origin.

## Implementation

- Static, no framework: `src/content.js` (copy), `src/render.js` (markup),
  five style layers `src/styles/{tokens,base,layout,components,sections}.css`
  concatenated in that order, and one classic script `src/js/site.js`.
- **The layers are concatenated, so a media query in an earlier layer loses to a
  plain rule in a later one.** A component's responsive rules belong in that
  component's layer. This has already bitten once: `.header-cta { display:none }`
  written in `layout.css` was overridden by `.btn { display:inline-flex }` in
  `components.css`, and the header overflowed every phone. That rule now lives
  in `components.css`.
- `site.js` is enhancement only. Nothing may be hidden in the markup waiting for
  a script: the nav is a visible list until the script collapses it, the
  carousel is a native scroll container until the script adds buttons, and the
  portrait swaps on hover in pure CSS. A test asserts the markup ships nothing
  pre-hidden.
- **The collapsed menu leaves the tab order through CSS `visibility`, and that
  property is never transitioned.** Clip-path, opacity and pointer-events hide
  it from the eye and the mouse but leave every link keyboard-focusable. Every
  way of animating `visibility` — a delay, or `allow-discrete` — holds the
  computed value at `visible` until the animation ends, leaving a window in
  which Shift+Tab reaches a menu that went invisible 100ms ago. Both were tried
  and both were wrong. The menu therefore closes instantly and only opening
  animates; that is the deliberate price of the guarantee.
  Keeping this in CSS rather than toggling `inert` from the script means it
  tracks the media query exactly and cannot go stale — a script-held copy of
  the breakpoint got the desktop navigation inert and keyboard-unreachable
  while this was being built.
- **The hamburger is shown by `.site-nav[data-collapsed] ~ .nav-toggle`, never
  by the breakpoint alone.** `data-collapsed` is set by the script, so without
  JavaScript the toggle stays hidden instead of sitting there dead beside a
  menu it cannot open. In that no-script case the header drops out of `fixed`
  and wraps, because four tracked links plus the wordmark and the language
  switch do not fit one 360px row.
- **Contact is reachable at every width and duplicated at none.** Above 900px
  the solid header button carries it and `.nav-contact` is hidden; below 900px
  the button is hidden and the collapsed menu carries it. The two rules are
  exact mirrors and live side by side in `components.css` for that reason —
  changing one without the other either loses Contact on phones or prints it
  twice on desktop. A test asserts both rules exist.
- **Every tap target is at least 44px**, including both language words, the
  footer social icons and the carousel arrows. A test measures the rules. On
  phones the header row's gaps shrink rather than the targets.
- No external origins at all: no CDN, no analytics, no remote fonts or images.
  The Worker's CSP is `script-src 'self'` and there are no inline `<script>`
  elements — the test enforces both.
- JavaScript budget: **4 KB gzipped**. If it is ever hit, remove behaviour
  rather than raising the number.
- Accessibility: one `h1` per page, AA contrast, visible `:focus-visible`, tap
  targets ≥ 44 px, `prefers-reduced-motion` disables every transition.
- Production is `https://ks-design.art`. Keep canonical, Open Graph, sitemap,
  and robots URLs on that origin even when a Cloudflare stage builds the same
  source.
- The production Compose project is `ks-design-portfolio` and may publish only
  `127.0.0.1:3100`. Do not reuse the `capsule-zero` Compose project, networks,
  volumes, images, ports, or Nginx configuration.

## The hero portrait

- Two frames cross-fade in the same box: `assets/portrait/calm-*` and
  `assets/portrait/wink-*`. The hover expression comes from the client's exact
  reference in `source-assets/portrait-rock-reference.png`. Register that source
  rigidly to the fixed head position, then keep its complete face — from the
  brows through the open mouth, lower oval and elongated chin — at the source
  proportions. Do not morph its jaw toward the shorter calm-frame jaw. The head
  position, crown, hair, headband, loose strands, neck, shoulders, clothes,
  background and crop stay fixed to the calm frame. The viewer-right ear,
  earring and adjacent edge hair remain literal calm-frame pixels in the hover
  export. Transfer the hover face through the full lower oval and its elongated
  chin shadow, with the smooth outer seam running outside that contour and
  fading into the fixed calm neck before the garment. Do not scale or stretch
  the face to meet the ear, and do not import the reference garment edge.
  Immediately outside the single hover jaw line, keep a clean calm-background
  field with only the natural 1–2 px edge antialiasing: no second skin edge,
  translucent halo or triangular matte before the shoulder.
  Moving the fixed regions between frames breaks the illusion of a single
  continuous shot.
- Take the hover jaw line from the registered reference itself rather than from
  whatever survives around a defect. Reconstructing it by joining the intact
  ends across a damaged stretch cuts the jaw short, because the surviving ends
  sit inboard of the true edge.
- Where a face feature crosses the seam into the fixed calm neck — the crease
  below the chin — the two sources place it a few pixels apart. Carry the hover
  segment across to meet the calm one and keep the feature's depth changing
  smoothly along its whole length. A sideways step, or a break in depth at the
  meeting point, reads as a defect even when each segment alone looks right.
- Remove the source photo's narrow dark sliver at the extreme bottom-right from
  both exported frames so that defect neither remains visible nor flickers.
- The portrait URLs carry a `?v=N` cache-buster (the `version` option of
  `picture()` in `src/render.js`). Bump it whenever the exported frames'
  pixels change under the same file names, or browsers and CDNs keep showing
  the previous export.
- The frame is `aspect-ratio: 776 / 971`, the exact aspect of the source pair,
  and the images are `object-fit: cover` with no `object-position` shift. Zero
  crop means zero drift between the two states.
- The cross-fade is ~140 ms on purpose. Slower reads as a slideshow dissolve;
  at this speed the eye reads a cut, which is the requested gif feel.
- On hover a frosted panel rises over the **sweater, never the face** — it is
  anchored to the bottom of the frame. It carries the selling numbers only.
- The panel is a **sibling** of `.portrait`, not a child. `.portrait` is
  `role="img"`, and descendants of an `img` role are presentational, so numbers
  nested inside it would be silent for assistive tech. A test asserts the
  ordering.

## Dependencies

The only dependency is `wrangler`, and it is needed for deployment, never for
`npm run build` or the tests — those use Node builtins alone.

`package.json` pins `undici` to `7.29.0` through `overrides` because wrangler
resolves `7.28.0`, which the repository's OSV scan flags. `alex-neon/website`
carries the same pin for the same reason. Drop it once wrangler's own range
moves past the advisory, and regenerate the lockfile with
`npm install --package-lock-only`.

## Regenerating assets

The social card renders the real page fonts through headless Chrome, so it
cannot drift from the design:

```bash
node website/scripts/make-og.mjs
```

Portfolio card screenshots, from the live stages. Every card is 1200×750 and
800×500 in both JPEG and WebP, so a new shot must be taken at the section's
8:5 proportion rather than cropped into it:

```bash
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --headless --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars --force-device-scale-factor=2 --window-size=1440,900 --virtual-time-budget=9000 --screenshot=shot.png https://chaijana.ks-design.workers.dev
```

Two cards need more than that flag. Ember's shot must catch the animation
mid-burn, so it is taken through the DevTools protocol: open the study, click
Play, wait about 1.3 seconds, then capture — a plain `--screenshot` grabs the
resting figure. Mikhail Orlov's page holds its entrance reveals until the
content scrolls into view, so a wide window screenshots as an empty sheet;
shoot it at 1000×625 (or drive it over the protocol with a pause after load)
and scale to the card sizes.

Neither is part of `npm run build`; both outputs are committed.

## Checks

From the repository root:

```bash
node scripts/check-repository.mjs
```

```bash
npm --prefix website run check
```

Tests cover the client's wording, the price list, the multilingual contract
(English at `/` as `x-default`, `hreflang` for both, no untranslated Russian in
either page, one `404.html` per locale, the `/en/` redirect), the
one-meaning-per-section and one-CTA-per-screen rules, the footer row, the
screenshots' fixed proportion, approved outbound links, local-only assets, the no-JavaScript guarantee,
the achromatic palette, grey contrast against AA, the accessibility structure,
and the script budget. Do not weaken a test to make a change pass.

Visually: 360 px and 1280 px+, both locales, keyboard focus, the portrait
swap on hover and on tap, the carousel at every breakpoint,
`prefers-reduced-motion`, and a console with no errors.

### Two traps when verifying this project

Both of these have already produced confident, wrong diagnoses. Read them before
concluding that something is broken.

**Headless Chrome cannot photograph this layout directly.** It clamps the layout
viewport to a minimum of 500 px, so a `--window-size=390` capture renders at
500 px and crops — which looks exactly like a horizontal-overflow bug and is not
one. It also screenshots from the top of the document, so `#anchor` captures
come back blank. Measure overflow and slide heights in a real browser; use
headless only for tall full-page captures with the deck's `100svh` temporarily
pinned to a pixel height in `dist/`.

**In a backgrounded browser pane (`document.hidden === true`), CSS transitions
and `requestAnimationFrame` never advance.** Transitioned properties stay stuck
at their pre-transition values, so `getComputedStyle` reports `opacity: 1` and
`visibility: visible` on an element the stylesheet has already hidden, and the
carousel's rAF-scheduled sync never runs. To test anything transitioned, set
`element.style.transition = 'none'`, read the value, then restore it — that
isolates the cascade from the stalled animation clock.
